I'll look at the average energy, valence, and danceability of a person's top 100 songs because that's the information we have. But there are many limitations. For example, we would assume that the person's mood has not changed from 2018 to now. Maybe we can partially solve this by adding more information in the characterization, and giving more weight to the information of the current year.
