sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: Because in the random50000 case, sort1 is the slowest algorithm, but in the sorted50000 it is in the middle and we spect O(n^2) and O(n) respectivily

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: Because in the random50000 and sorted50000 cases, sort2 is the fastest algorithm, and we spect O(n log(n))

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: Because in the random50000 case, sort1 is the slowest algorithm, and have a similar time in sorted50000 case, and we spect O(n^2) always
