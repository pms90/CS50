Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

No one of the predictions proved to be incorrect, but more number of simulations make a more correct predictions.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It will depends on the cost of the second of compute time and what are the goal of the prediction, but i think that 1000 or 10000 are good enough.
